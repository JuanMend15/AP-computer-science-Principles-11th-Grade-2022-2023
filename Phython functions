#functions
'''A function is a block of code wich only runs when it is called. you can pass data known as parameter, into a function.A function can get data a a result'''
# creating a Function 
#in Phython a function is created using def keyword
def my_function ():
  print("Hello from a function");
my_function()
# calling a function 
# to call a function name followed by pharentesis
#Example
def my_functions (fname):
  print(fname +" Joaquin")
my_functions ("pizza")
#PARAMETERS AND ARGUMENTS
# The term parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function 
# A parameter is the variable listed inside the parenthesis inthe function definition 
# an argument is the value that is sent to the function when its called 
def my_function (fname, lname):
  print(fname+" "+ lname)
my_function("carlos","campuzano")

#phython Class
# to create a class, keyword class
# create a clas named MyClass, with a property named x
class Myclass:
  x= 5
  #create an object named g1, and print the value of x
  # print the value of x
# the_init_()Function
# Use the_init_ Function to assign values for name and age :
# Ex.Create a class named named Person,use the_init_()function to assign vlues for name and age 
class person:
  def __init__(self,name,age):
    self.name =name
    self.age =age
p1 = person("john",36)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
# note the _int_() dunction is called automatically everytime the class is being used to create a new object
# phython inheritance 
# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class 
# Parent class is the class being inhereted from, also clled/base class/
# Child class is the clas being inhereted from,also called /deived class/
# ex. create a s class named Person, with first name and last name properties, and a printname method
class person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.fname = fname
    self.lname = lname
  def printname(self):
    print(self.fname, self.lname)
'''Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method '''
x= person("armando", "legos")
x.printname()
#properties, and a print name an object, and then execute the printname method 

x.printname()

# Child class
# To crate a class that inherts the functionally from another class,send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class
class students:
 pass
# ex: use the student classto create an object, and then execute the printname method 
x=student ("vicente","cuaron")
x.printname()
